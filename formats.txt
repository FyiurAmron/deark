Deark -- Information about supported formats


=== Image format modules ===

(Images will be converted to PNG, except as noted.)

* Amiga Workbench Icon (module="amigaicon")
  - Original format: Mostly supported, but the format is not portable, and
    there is not just one correct way to render the images.

  - GlowIcons / OS3.5: Compressed images are supported. Uncompressed images are
    not.

* BSAVE (module="bsave")

   -opt bsave:fmt=cga4  - 320x200 4-color
   -opt bsave:fmt=cga16 - Very low (160x100) resolution
