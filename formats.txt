Deark -- Information about supported formats


=== Image format modules ===

(Images will be converted to PNG, except as noted.)

* Amiga Workbench Icon (module="amigaicon")
  - Original format: Mostly supported, but the format is not portable, and
    there is not just one correct way to render the images.

    not.

* PC Paint / Pictor (module="pcpaint")
  - Supports PIC and CLP formats. Some files are not portable, because they use
    a nonstandard palette that is not contained in the file.
  - Supports most images with 8 or fewer bits/pixel.
  Options
   -opt pcpaint:fmt=pic
   -opt pcpaint:fmt=clp
   -opt palfile=<file.pic> - PIC file to read the palette from

* Psion PIC (module="psionpic")
  A Psion PIC file contains one or more 1-bpp bitmaps, some of which can be
  combined to make grayscale images. Deark will try to guess which images
  should be combined, but it may not always get it right.
  - Supports 1- and 2-bit grayscale.
  Options
   -opt psionpic:bw - Do not try to detect grayscale images. Write each bitmap
     as a separate image.

* RIPscrip icon (.ICN) (module="ripicon") (experimental)
  - Not autodetected. Must use "-m ripicon".
