Deark -- Information about supported formats


=== Image format modules ===

(Images will be converted to PNG, except as noted.)

* Amiga Workbench Icon (module="amigaicon")
  - Original format: Mostly supported, but the format is not portable, and
    there is not just one correct way to render the images.
  - NewIcons: Fully supported.
  - GlowIcons / OS3.5: Compressed images are supported. Uncompressed images are
    not.

* BSAVE (module="bsave")
  Support (some) PC-style BSAVE files.
  Options
   -opt bsave:width=<n>
   -opt bsave:height=<n>
   -opt bsave:fmt=char  - Character graphics, converted to HTML format
   -opt bsave:fmt=cga2  - 640x200 2-color
   -opt bsave:fmt=cga4  - 320x200 4-color
   -opt bsave:fmt=cga16 - Very low (160x100) resolution
   -opt bsave:fmt=mcga  - 320x200 256-color
   -opt palfile=<file.pal> - Use this palette file (BSAVE format)
   -opt bsave:fmt=wh2   - 2-color, header includes width & height
   -opt bsave:fmt=wh4   - 4 color, header includes width & height
   -opt bsave:fmt=wh16  - 16 color, header includes width & height, inter-row
     interlaced
   -opt bsave:fmt=b265  - Special
   -opt bsave:fmt=2col  - 2-color noninterlaced (experimental)
   -opt bsave:fmt=4col  - 4-color noninterlaced (experimental)

* EPOC MBM/Sketch/AIF (module="epocimage")
  - Supports grayscale with 2 or 4 bits/pixel
  - Supports palette color with 4 or 8 bits/pixel
  - Supports 16/24 bit full color
  - Supports uncompressed and RLE8/RLE16/RLE24 compression

* HP 100LX / HP 200LX .ICN icon format (module="hpicn")

* MacPaint (module="macpaint")
  - Also extracts brush patterns (as PNG) (use -extractall)
  Options
   -opt macpaint:macbinary=<0|1>

* MSP (Microsoft Paint graphics) (module="msp")
  - Version 1 and 2

* OS/2 Icon, Pointer, Bitmap Array formats (module="os2bmp")
  - Converts icons & pointers to individual PNG files.
  - Extract Bitmap Array BMP images as individual BMP files.

* PC Paint / Pictor (module="pcpaint")
  - Supports PIC and CLP formats. Some files are not portable, because they use
    a nonstandard palette that is not contained in the file.
  - Supports most images with 8 or fewer bits/pixel.
  Options
   -opt pcpaint:fmt=pic
   -opt pcpaint:fmt=clp
   -opt palfile=<file.pic> - PIC file to read the palette from

* Psion PIC (module="psionpic")
  A Psion PIC file contains one or more 1-bpp bitmaps, some of which can be
  combined to make grayscale images. Deark will try to guess which images
  should be combined, but it may not always get it right.
  - Supports 1- and 2-bit grayscale.
  Options
   -opt psionpic:bw  - Do not try to detect grayscale images. Write each bitmap
     as a separate image.


=== Compression and archive modules ===

* zlib (module="zlib")
  - Raw zlib files can be uncompressed.


=== File extraction modules ===

* ANI (Windows Animated Cursor) (module="ani")
  - Extract individual CUR and ICO files.

* Copy (module="copy")
  - "Extract" the entire file. Use with -start and -size to extract part of
    the file.

* EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) (module="eps")
  - Extract EPS, TIFF, and WMF from "EPS DOS Binary" format.

* EXE/PE/NE/etc. (module="exe")
  - Extract bitmaps, icons, and cursors from NE and PE (Windows .exe) files.
  - Extract fonts.
  - Extract embedded manifests (use -extractall).
  - Extract bitmaps from LX (Linear Executable) files. Note that some of these
    may be in "Bitmap Array" format. Reprocess them with Deark to extract the
    actual BMP file(s).
  - Extract icons and cursors from LX files. Note that these will use OS/2
    format. Reprocess them with Deark to convert to PNG.

* GRASP GL animation (module="graspgl")
  - Extracts all files.

* JPEG (module="jpeg")
  - Extract ICC profiles.
  - Extract Exif JPEG-formatted thumbnails.
  - Extract JFXX JPEG-formatted thumbnails (rare).
  - Extract various things from Exif data.
  - Extract various things from "Photoshop resources"
  - Extract Exif data (use -extractall)

* JPEG 2000 (module="jpeg2000")
  - Extract JPEG 2000 codestream from JP2/JPX/JPM formats.
  - Extract XML data.
  - Extract GeoTIFF data.
  - Extract XMP data.
  - Extract Exif data (use -extractall) (nonstandard; partial support)
  - Extract various things from "Photoshop resources".

* PSD (PhotoShop) (module="psd")
  - Extract data from "Photoshop resources"

  * Photoshop resources
    - Extract JPEG thumbnails. Some thumbnail images have the red and blue
      channels swapped -- Deark warns about this but does not correct it.
    - Extract various things from Exif data.
    - Extract Exif data (use -extractall).
    - Extract IPTC data (use -extractall).

* Psion APP/IMG and OPA/OPO (module="psionapp")
  - Extract Psion PIC icons.
  - Extract other contents (use -extractall).

* TIFF and Exif (module="tiff")
  - Extract JPEG-formatted Exif thumbnails, and some types of Old-style
    JPEG-compressed images.
  - Extract ICC profiles.
  - Extract data from "Photoshop resources",
  - Extract IPTC data (use -extractall).
